## Description

This was a wedding website I built with React for my wedding in 2019. 

Features Include:
- RSVP system that allows administration of who is invited, if you are giving them a plus one, and group them for invitations. It generates human-readable passwords for these groups that can be printed on invitations so guests can RSVP through the website, select their meals, and track plus one names. This prevents random people from RSVPing and allows us to decide who has a plus one.
- A chatbot that connects to my phone to help anyone in real time to RSVP or answer any questions they could have.
- A form for guests to recommend songs for the reception. The form validates the song against the Apple music library and prevents duplicates for ease of handing a list to the DJ.
- A form for guests to leave stories to share during the reception
- A Google Maps applet that shows wedding location
- A place to learn about the wedding, location, and bridal party


### Notes

I started it in 2017 to learn more about developing with React.
The server has since been shut down, but I have migrated the repository from a legacy git system to save my first complete personal project.
